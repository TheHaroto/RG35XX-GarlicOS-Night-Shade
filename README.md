To install your new theme, copy the CFW folder over your CFW folder on your 'ROMs' Drive and replace all files.

To install the Boot Loader image copy the boot_logo.bmp.gz file in the Boot Logo folder into your the root of your 'Misc' Drive (The one containing the modules folder).

If you have/want custom boxart and want it to appear like it does on the previews of the theme, you can follow the guide on how to do this correctly at https://retrogamecorps.com/2023/01/03/anbernic-rg35xx-starter-guide/

There is also a PDF installation guide with this information in the zip files as well.

We recommend doing a full backup of your files, specifically the CFW folder, and your boot_logo.bmp.gz before transferring the files just incase something goes wrong!
